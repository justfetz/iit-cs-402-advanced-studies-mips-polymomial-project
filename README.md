## Mips Polynomial Project

### MIPS is an example of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) which was designed for easy instruction
pipelining. MIPS has a “Load/Store” architecture since all instructions (other than the load and store
instructions) must use register operands. MIPS has 32 32-bit “general purpose” registers ($0, $1, $2, ... , $31),
but some of these have special uses (see MIPS Register Conventions table).
 
 ### About

 ### Comments
 Thank god this class is over.
