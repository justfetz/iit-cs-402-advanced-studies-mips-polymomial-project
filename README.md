## MIPS Polynomial Project

### Overview
MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a classic example of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. Designed for efficient instruction pipelining, MIPS uses a “Load/Store” architecture where all operations, except for load and store instructions, are performed on register operands. The MIPS architecture features 32 general-purpose 32-bit registers (`$0` to `$31`), with some registers designated for special purposes according to the MIPS Register Conventions.

### About
This project is part of the curriculum for the course CS 402: Computer Organization and Assembly at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

### Requirements
The objective of this project is to use MIPS Assembly Language to evaluate the polynomial expression:
\[ a(x^2) + b(x) + c \]

### Project Details
- **Language:** MIPS Assembly
- **Tools:** MIPS simulator (e.g., MARS or SPIM)

### Instructions
1. **Setup MIPS Simulator:**
   - Download and install a MIPS simulator such as MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) or SPIM.
   - Ensure the simulator is correctly configured for running MIPS Assembly programs.

2. **Implement the Polynomial Expression:**
   - Write MIPS Assembly code to calculate the polynomial expression \( a(x^2) + b(x) + c \).
   - The code should take input values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x`, and then output the result of the expression.

3. **Testing:**
   - Test the program with various input values to ensure correctness.
   - Validate the output against expected results for known inputs.
